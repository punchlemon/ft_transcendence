# INSTRUCTION: PHASE 0 (INITIALIZATION & ARCHITECTURE DESIGN)

You have been provided with:
1. `rules.md`: The general development protocols.
2. `subject.md`: The OFFICIAL requirements document for this project.

**YOUR GOAL**:
Analyze the Subject and establish the foundational architecture and plan.

**ACTIONS**:

1. **Tech Stack Selection**:
   - Analyze `subject.md` to identify constraints (e.g., specific languages, frameworks, forbidden libraries).
   - Select the best Tech Stack (Backend, Frontend, DB, Testing) that meets the requirements.
   - **OUTPUT**: Create a file named **`.ai/tech_stack.md`** defining these choices strictly.

2. **Project Planning**:
   - Define the Directory Architecture based on the selected stack.
   - Create a granular Task List (Epics > Stories > Tasks).
   - **OUTPUT**: Create the initial content for **`PROJECT_MASTER.md`** (in Japanese).

3. **Output Summary**:
   - Explicitly output the raw markdown content for both `.ai/tech_stack.md` and `PROJECT_MASTER.md`.
